This repository documents our progress in reverse engineering and modding the ubiquitous 20/68/? speeds `wireless remote massage egg' as sold on sites like Aliexpress by many sellers (and around the internet for a serious mark-up).
More information can be found on the relevant [CCC wiki project page](http://events.ccc.de/camp/2015/wiki/Projects:Teledildonics).

Thanks to Ikarus for contributing a remote control for the eggs based on GNURadio!
